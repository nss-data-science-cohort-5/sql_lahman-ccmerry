--1. Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. 
--Create a list showing each player's first and last names as well as the total salary 
--they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total 
--salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?
WITH pschool AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT people.playerid, people.namefirst, people.namelast, cp.schoolid, schools.schoolname
	FROM people
		LEFT JOIN collegeplaying AS cp
		ON people.playerid = cp.playerid
		LEFT JOIN schools
		ON cp.schoolid = schools.schoolid
	WHERE schools.schoolname = 'Vanderbilt University'),
psalary AS (
	SELECT playerid, sum(salary) AS career_earnings
	FROM salaries
	GROUP BY playerid)
SELECT pschool.namefirst, pschool.namelast, psalary.career_earnings
FROM pschool
	INNER JOIN psalary
	ON pschool.playerid = psalary.playerid
WHERE psalary.career_earnings IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY psalary.career_earnings DESC;

--2. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: 
--label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" 
--as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number 
--of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.
SELECT sum(po) AS total_po,
	CASE WHEN pos = 'OF' THEN 'Outfield'
	WHEN pos IN ('P','C') THEN 'Battery'
	ELSE 'Infield' END
	AS posgroup
FROM fielding
WHERE yearid = 2016
GROUP BY posgroup

--Battery: 41424
--Infield: 58934
--Outfield: 29560

--3. Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. 
--Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. 
--Do you see any trends? (Hint: For this question, you might find it helpful 
--to look at the **generate_series** function (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-srf.html).
--If you want to see an example of this in action, check out this DataCamp video: 
--https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-sql/summarizing-and-aggregating-numeric-data?ex=6)
SELECT trunc(yearid,-1) AS decade, ROUND(SUM(so) / (SUM(g)/2.00), 2) AS soperg
FROM teams
WHERE trunc(yearid,-1) >= 1920
GROUP BY decade
ORDER BY decade

--Strikeouts are increasing


--4. Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, 
--where __success__ is measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful. 
--(A stolen base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) 
--Consider only players who attempted _at least_ 20 stolen bases. Report the players' names, 
--number of stolen bases, number of attempts, and stolen base percentage.
SELECT batting.playerid, people.namefirst, people.namelast, SUM(sb) / (SUM(cs) + SUM(sb) +0.00) AS sbpct
FROM batting
	LEFT JOIN people
	ON batting.playerid = people.playerid
WHERE yearid = 2016
GROUP BY batting.playerid, people.namefirst, people.namelast
HAVING (SUM(cs) + SUM(sb)) >= 20
ORDER BY sbpct DESC

--5. From 1970 to 2016, what is the largest number of wins for a team that did not win the world series?
SELECT teamid, w
FROM teams
WHERE yearid BETWEEN 1970 AND 2016
AND wswin = 'N'
ORDER BY w DESC
LIMIT 1

--116


--What is the smallest number of wins for a team that did win the world series? 
SELECT teamid, w, l, yearid
FROM teams
WHERE yearid BETWEEN 1970 AND 2016
AND wswin = 'Y'
ORDER BY w
LIMIT 1

--63There were fewer games due to MLB strike

--Doing this will probably result in an unusually small number of wins for a world series champion; 
--determine why this is the case. Then redo your query, excluding the problem year. 

--There were fewer games due to MLB strike
SELECT teamid, w, yearid
FROM teams
WHERE yearid BETWEEN 1970 AND 2016
AND yearid != 1981
AND wswin = 'Y'
ORDER BY w
LIMIT 1

--How often from 1970 to 2016 was it the case that a team with the most wins also won the world series? 
--What percentage of the time?
SELECT teamid, w, yearid
FROM teams
WHERE yearid BETWEEN 1970 AND 2016
AND wswin = 'Y'
ORDER BY w


--6. Which managers have won the TSN Manager of the Year award in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL)? Give their full name and the teams that they were managing when they won the award.

--7. Which pitcher was the least efficient in 2016 in terms of salary / strikeouts? Only consider pitchers who started at least 10 games (across all teams). Note that pitchers often play for more than one team in a season, so be sure that you are counting all stats for each player.

--8. Find all players who have had at least 3000 career hits. Report those players' names, total number of hits, and the year they were inducted into the hall of fame (If they were not inducted into the hall of fame, put a null in that column.) Note that a player being inducted into the hall of fame is indicated by a 'Y' in the **inducted** column of the halloffame table.

--9. Find all players who had at least 1,000 hits for two different teams. Report those players' full names.

--10. Find all players who hit their career highest number of home runs in 2016. Consider only players who have played in the league for at least 10 years, and who hit at least one home run in 2016. Report the players' first and last names and the number of home runs they hit in 2016.
